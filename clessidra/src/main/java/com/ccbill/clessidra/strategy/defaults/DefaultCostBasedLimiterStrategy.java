/**
 * A useable {@link BaseCostBasedLimiterStrategy} that groups all the
 * invocations under the same strategy group and returns a cost of 1 for every
 * method invocation. Although this limiter strategy is fully usable it has the
 * same effect as {@link DefaultInvocationRateLimiterStrategy} due to the fixed
 * cost of 1. The main purpose of this class is to be show how a cost based
 * limiter strategy would look like. In practice the user should override
 * {@link BaseCostBasedLimiterStrategy} and implement the proper cost
 * calculation.
